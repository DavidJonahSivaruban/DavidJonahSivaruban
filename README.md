## Hey👋, I'm David, a <strong> Frontend Web Developer </strong> from Malaysia.

<p> 💡<strong> A Bit About Me </strong></p> 
Ex-Recruiter turned Web Developer! My journey started in recruitment, where I developed a deep understanding of account management, talent strategy, and client solutioning over the past 5+ years. However, my love for technology and design led me to pivot into frontend development through a local coding bootcamp where I learnt fullstack web development. <br>
